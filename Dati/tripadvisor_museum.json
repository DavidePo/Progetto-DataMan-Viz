It was Champollion who famously wrote, The road to Memphis and Thebes passes through Turin.The collections that make up todays Museum, were enlarged by the excavations conducted in Egypt by the Museums archaeological mission between 1900 and 1935 (a period when finds were divided between the excavators and Egypt).The Egyptian Museum in Turin has begun 2009 an important project which wants to widen spaces in order to enhance the collections through modern museographical and museological criteria. The Museum will be open all over the period of restoration and the New Egyptian Museum inauguration is scheduled for the year 2015.",

   "Description": "KGB for many years have been of the most powerful and famous secret service in the world. The KGB museum was founded by the organization Chernyy dozhd. This non-governmental private organization is a community of people who are fascinated with the history collected unique items related to the activities of the Soviet Secret Service. The presence of many exhibits is primarily due to anarchy and lack of control over many state museums in the USSR during its division into many independent states, which used to be former Soviet socialist republics. Only due to the Chernyy dozhd organization many priceless exhibits were saved from looting, destruction and recycling. This is the first time in the world memorabilia previously belonging to the first persons of the Soviet Union, the heads of the Cheka-NKVD-GPU-OGPU-MGB-KGB and the senior functionaries of the soviet state security are put together in one place.The exhibition features absolutely unique exhibits such as Lenin death mask, which was made in January 1924 by Doctors of Medicine Vorobiev and Zbarsky (the authors of the unique embalming technique of dead body); the weapon, which was used for Trotskys murder in Mexico in 1940; the personal belongings from the cabinet of Beria, who was Marshal of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), a chief of the Soviet security service during the difficult years of World War II, and later a supervisor of the Soviet atomic bomb project; an unusual type of small arms, chemical weapons, made according to then-advanced technology, and many other exhibits. A part of the exhibition showcases the history of the personal standard weapon of the Soviet secret service officers.In the 20th century such kind of technique was actively developed, designed and produced by secret laboratories, institutes and specialized factories of Warsaw Pact countries, and especially by the Soviet Union.Gifted scientists, talented designers and highly skilled engineers with unique abilities were engaged into this invisible and closed for ordinary people industry.Hidden cameras (in the Soviet Union they used the term \"tacit photography\"), things which were used for keeping secret information (dead drops), instruments for applying signal labels, standard gifts for the officers and employees of the KGB to celebrate various anniversaries in the history of the USSR and the KGB, the first merit badges of the agents, and all the things which were inextricably connected with the activities of Soviet intelligence officers can be seen now at the KGB Museum in Prague. A part of the exhibition is dedicated to the so-called \"Prague Spring\". Many unique photos of the city streets were made by the KGB agents during the events of 1968. Unusual photos reflect the dramatic history of that time, the tragedy of the beautiful old European city, which fate became a bargaining chip in a great gamble game of superpowers. One can also see an extraordinarily beautiful handmade banner that had been made by the children from the GPU labour commune for 2 months and was presented to Grampa Lenin in the autumn 1923, three months before his death. After the Soviet state heads death the banner, as well as the flags from the GPU NKVD RSFSR, had been held over the World Proletariat Leader's body in the House of Unions' Pillar Hall for 3 days. In that frosty cold January of the year 1924 a three day procession of more than a million people walked past the Lenin's coffin.. The vision of and comments on the existence of the most powerful secret services of the world can vary, but it's obviously clear that every state needs a strong secret service, the instrument of its foreign and domestic policy.",

The Hawaii Army Society Museum Store (HAMS) closes at 4 pm. The Museum is free to all. Audio tours are available for rent from the Society for a small fee in both English and Japanese. Parking is available directly across from the museum. Validation for a reduced parking fee is available at the welcome desk. Constructed from 1909 to 1911, this Coastal Artillery Battery protected Oahu with its two 14-inch disappearing guns. The battery was built so well that it was unable to be torn down in the early 1970's to make way for the military's Hale Koa Hotel. The battery was turned into a museum in 1976 and begins with early Hawaiian warfare and covers every major military event in the Pacific theater of operations through Vietnam. The Gallery of Heroes honors Hawaii's soldiers who have received our nation's highest awards: the Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Service Cross. Chartered in 1976 as a not-for-profit corporation, the Hawaii Army Museum Society, also known by its acronym, HAMS, was organized by several former military veterans and patriotic members of the Honolulu community. HAMS is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization whose mission is to support the U. S. Army Museum of Hawaii. HAMS is a non-federal entity.

Nearly all his prints are exhibited, among them Belvedere, Drawing Hands, Waterfall and Ascending and Descending. Here you can see how Escher changed fishes into birds, made water flow upstream and his less known, but very attractive early Italian landscapes. On our main- and first floor you can see how his work progressed from depicting the real world to his constructed worlds. Optical illusion is a key word in his work.An optical illusion depicts something which is in fact impossible. M.C. Escher was a master in this field. An optical illusion literally means doing puzzles with your eyes. The visitor will be able to unravel some of Eschers mysteries like the Impossible Penrose Triangle by constructing one himself. The extra presentation In the Eye of Escher shows various themes in which Escher was involved, like reflection, perception and perspective.",

Erarta building also has a restaurant, a cafe and several museum shops offering gifts, prints and books and is open every day (except for Tuesdays) from 10am to 10pm",

We also have a comprehensive collection of aero-engines.Our mighty Sandringham Flying Boat was originally built as a Short Sunderland in 1943, and converted to a passenger aircraft after the war. Visitors are welcome to board the aircraft to sample the luxury of air travel in the romantic era of the great flying boats, and guided tours of the flight deck are also available.Kids (and big kids) can also imagine what it would be like to fly a jet fighter while sat in the cockpits of our Supermarine Swift and Harrier Jump Jet. Our new Schneider Trophy Exhibition is now open, with its record-breaking centrepiece the S6a. Video stock footage of these legendary races and artefacts from the time illustrate the drama and romance of the fastest race in history.",

   "Description": "The Fundaci Joan Mir was created by Mir himself, at first principally with works from his own private collection, with a desire to set up an internationally recognised centre in Barcelona for Mir scholarship and contemporary art research, and to disseminate the collection. The Fundaci opened to the public on 10 June 1975 and has since become a dynamic centre in which Joan Mir's work coexists with cutting-edge contemporary art. With an interdisciplinary approach, the Fundaci organises temporary exhibitions of 20th and 21st century artists as well as academic activities and projects in collaboration with other institutions and organisations. Through its exhibition and educational programmes, the Fundaci Joan Mir explores lines of research linked to the work of Mir and to contemporary art. The Fundaci is located in a building designed by Josep Llus Sert, making it one of the few museums anywhere in the world in which the complicity between artist and architect underpins the dialogue between the works and the space that houses them. The Fundaci offers an overview of the landscapes of Joan Mir's art and life, creating an enriching dialogue with other artists from the 20th and 21st centuries.",

From her vision arose the Whitney Museum of American Art, which has been championing the most innovative art of the United States for more than eighty years. The core of the Whitney's mission is to collect, preserve, interpret, and exhibit American art of our time and serve a wide variety of audiences in celebration of the complexity and diversity of art and culture in the United States. Through this mission and a steadfast commitment to artists themselves, the Whitney has long been a powerful force in support of modern and contemporary art and continues to help define what is innovative and influential in American art today.",

In 2006 we ran our first public exhibition \"The Story of Ipoh: From Feet to Flight\", in cooperation with Darul Ridzuan Museum. Since then, supported by sponsorship, we have run several more exhibitions while continuing to seek further financial support for a permanent, lively and interesting heritage gallery for Ipoh, thus enhancing both education and tourism. This current project, our first permanent, museum quality exhibition is our first step to fulfilling this objective. Advance booking is recommended as space in the building is limited. You may book via our website by clicking on Exhibitions or by the QR Code on our brochure. It is quick and easy and you receive a booking confirmation by return.",

   "Description": "The National War Museum, housed within the fortified walls of Fort St. Elmo, houses a superb collection of artefacts. Displayed in a chronological manner, these artefacts narrate the military history of Malta from the early phases of the Bronze Age, around 2,500 B.C. when the first inhabitants arrived from Sicily, to Malta's EU Accession in 2004. Prominence is given to periods that deeply marked Malta's often turbulent history. The arrival of the Knights of the Order of St. John and the resultant Great Siege of 1565, including the construction of Valletta, fortresses and fortifications, coastal towers and other coastal fortifications, and Malta as a British Fortress Colony under the British Empire and the two great wars of the 20th Century. The museum provides particular insight into Malta's significant role during the Fist World War, the Inter-War Period and Malta's historical part in the Second World War. Perhaps the three most important artefacts on display are the Gloster Sea Gladiator N5520 FAITH, Roosevelt's Jeep 'Husky', and Malta's award for gallantry, the George Cross.",

Housing a vast collection of Niagara Falls history, the Museum provides a showcase for the unique past of the famous city. The Museum's recent $12M renovation and expansion creates a dynamic space to examine and explore our diverse history. It re-opened to the public on July 21, 2012. The renovation and expansion was designed by Toronto architecture firm Moriyama and Teshima, and now features three remarkable galleries telling the most compelling Niagara Falls stories with engaging hands-on exhibitions. The Museum is located within steps of the Drummond Hill Cemetery, the focal point of the Battle of Lundy's Lane, considered the \"bloodiest battle\" of the War of 1812. The starting point for any trip to this battlefield will be a visit to the Museum.Besure to also check out the Battle Ground Hotel Museum and Willoughby Historical Museum.The Niagara Falls Museums are a municipally-run trio of sites dedicated to preserving the history of the City of Niagara Falls and the surrounding area. Using both artifacts and text, they highlight the large and small things that made up daily life in the area's rich history. The Niagara Falls History Museum looks at early Black history, the War of 1812, notables like Sir Isaac Brock and Laura Secord, and even historic souvenirs. The Battle Ground Hotel Museum focuses on early tourism, from a time when tourists came to see not just the falls but also the 1812 battlefield. And Willoughby Historical Museum looks at everyday rural life, as well as commemorating the Battle of Chippawa. All three sites offer extensive collections, as well as programs and activities for schools and the public. The History Museum and the Willoughby Museum also offer research opportunities.",

In its unique history, it has assembled works from the early fifteenth century to the present. The Kunstmuseum Basel houses the Galerie (Gallery) and the Kupferstichkabinett (Department of Prints and Drawings). The main focus is on paintings and drawings by artists active in the Upper Rhine region between 1400 and 1600 and of the 19th and 21st century. The Kunstmuseum Basel possesses the world`s largest collection of works by the Holbein family. Further examples of Renaissance art include major pieces by masters such as Konrad Witz, Martin Schongauer, Lucas Cranach the Elder and Matthias Grnewald. Most of these early treasures originally belonged to the collection of a Basel lawyer, Basilius Amerbach. Purchased by the city in 1661, they formed the core of the world`s first public municipal museum. Paintings by Basel-born Arnold Bcklin feature among the 19th-century highlights. In the field of 20th-century art, the accent is on Cubism (Picasso, Braque, Lger), German Expressionism, Abstract Expressionism and American art since 1950. Contemporary art is exhibited at the Museum fr Gegenwartskunst (Museum of Contemporary Art).",

The events that took place here together with the preserved historical remnants and traces of border obstacles on display help to make the history of Germany's division comprehensible to visitors. The memorial is part of the Berlin Wall Foundation, which also includes the Marienfelde Refugee Center Museum, the central site dedicated to the history of flight and emigration in divided Germany.",

It was founded in 1953 by the Society of Cretan Historical Studies, which had been established two years earlier. The museum is housed in a two-storey neoclassical building, which was constructed in 1903 on the site of an earlier mansion belonging to the Kalokerinos family. The second building, designed by K. Tsandirakis, was clearly influenced by morphological features of the earlier one, and was later listed as a historical monument. The new museum extension to the west constituted an attempt to combine traditional and modern architecture. The original goal of those founding the Historical Museum of Crete was to collect and preserve valuable archaeological, ethnographic and historical material deriving from the medieval and modern periods in Cretan history. The process of enriching the collections, extending exhibition space and redefining the museum's aims has never ceased. Prolific research and publishing activity, the organisation of temporary exhibitions, educational programmes and the use of audiovisual media all form part of the modern educational role adopted by the Historical Museum of Crete over time. The same approach also includes the gradual re-organisation of the collections on display so as to appeal to a wider range of visitors, thus offering them the opportunity to understand the many facets of historical development on Crete from early Byzantine times to the present day.",

   "Description": "The Museo del Novecento, located inside the Palazzo dell'Arengario in Piazza del Duomo, hosts a collection of over four thousand works that catalyze the development of 20th century Italian art. The Museo del Novecento was established on 6 December 2010 with the goal of spreading knowledge of 20th century art and offering a more comprehensive insight into the collections that the city of Milan has inherited over time. Beside its core exhibition activity, the Museum is active in the conservation, investigation and promotion of 20th century Italian cultural and artistic heritage with the final aim of reaching an ever wider audience. With an eye toward the city, the Museo del Novecento develops around multiple locations. The Permanent Collection follows a chronological path where collective exhibitions alternate with solo art shows. The grand spiral staircase inside the building welcomes visitors and introduces them to the visit of the Museum with the Il Quarto Stato (The Fourth Estate) by Pellizza da Volpedo. The bookshop and the restaurant are the Museum's meeting places. The Neon by Lucio Fontana represents a final embrace to the city. Reflecting Milan's feverish cultural dynamism, the Permanent Collection is essentially the story of several private collections that have been brought together thanks to the generosity and passion for art of many private collectors. Since its inception, the collection has been augmented by major gifts from artists, collectors and philanthropists who play an active role in the growth of the Museum's heritage, which today reflects the rich trajectory of art from the early 20th century through the present. An outstanding example of architecture and, today, an impressive installation communicating directly with the city, since 2010 the Palazzo dell'Arengario has accommodated the Museo del Novecento. This landmark building, designed by Griffini, Magistretti, Muzio, and Portaluppi, was renovated by the Rota Group to host a richly layered collection of 20th century Italian art. The transformation of the Palazzo dell'Arengario was dictated by the need to organize the composition of Milan's Civiche Raccolte d'Arte (Municipal Art Collections) around two distinct poles. While the historic premises of Villa Reale were meant to host collections dating from the 19th century, the Palazzo dell'Arengario was singled out for the exhibits of 20th century artwork. The latter was particularly meaningful for the harmony existing between its architecture and the collection it was meant to display. This project enabled to best exploit the interior premises, while turning the building into one of the major cultural places in Milan. The grand spiral staircase inside the building is probably the most impressive architectural feature of the Museum: a functional element that connects several levels, from the subway up to the panoramic terrace overlooking the Duomo.",

Young ones, you are royalty in the Nursery, a space filled with colors, shapes and textures perfect for your growing minds and bodies. The Attic, Garage and Waterplay (because it's just not fun until your underwear is soaked) round out the permanent exhibits. But not so fast. From marching bands, slam poets and cultural traditions to letters that fall from the ceiling and a crawling maze made out of packing tape, our temporary exhibits, performers, programs, artists-in-residence and artwork are particularly awesome too.
